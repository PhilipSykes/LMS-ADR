# Use Service-oriented architecture

## Context and Problem Statement

The Advanced Media Library (AML) requires a modern library management system to streamline operations across various access points while serving a large user base across the country. The system needs to handle different media types, scale for future growth, maintain performance, and ensure data integrity.

How can we design an architecture that meets these requirements while allowing for performance and horizontal scalability?

## Decision Drivers

- Need for a system that can handle 13.4 million users with 10% annual growth i.e. how intuitively scalable is the architecture style
- Performance requirements for rapid search results and quick webpage loading times
- Requirement for centralized management with distributed operations
- Need to manage a large volume of diverse media types efficiently
- Need for easy updates and modifications without disrupting the entire system

## Considered Options

- Three-Tier Architecture
- Microservices Architecture
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)", because it gives us a balance between the flexibility of microservices and the simplicity of monolithic systems, while meeting our scalability and performance requirements.

### Consequences

- Good, because it has allowed us to explore a new unused architecture type for the team.
- Good, because it has honed our ability to delegate specific sections between the team.
- Good, because its provided the team with better fault isolation & hotfix options throughout development.
- Good, because it allows for easier integration of new technologies and services in the future.
- Bad, because it has resulted in an increased workload developing the various independant services.

### Confirmation

Architecture fully implemented as of sprint 2 with services deployed independently of each other locally or via docker thereby meeting our maintainability & scalability needs.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Three-Tier Architecture

- Good, because it's simpler to develop and deploy initially[1].
- Good, because it provides clear separation of concerns between presentation, business logic, and data layers[1]
- Bad, because horizontal scaling is more complex than in service-based architectures[4].
- Bad, because updates to one part of the system might require redeploying the entire application.
- Bad, because it might not meet our scalability and maintainability requirements in the long term.

### Microservices Architecture

- Good, because it offers the highest level of scalability and flexibility[2].
- Good, because it allows for independent deployment of services[2].
- Bad, because it introduces massive complexity in service management and communication.
- Bad, because it might be overkill for our current needs and could lead to over-engineering.
- Bad, because it requires more resources and expertise to implement and maintain effectively.

### Service-oriented Architecture

- Good, because it provides a balance between scalability and manageability.
- Good, because it allows for modular development and deployment of services.[5]
- Good, because unlike microservices, its inherently aimed at component sharing[3]
- Good, because it supports our maintainability requirements by allowing updates to individual services.
- Good, because it can help us meet our performance requirements with optimized service design.
- Neutral, because it introduces some complexity in service communication, but not as much as microservices.
- Bad, because it may require more initial setup compared to a monolithic or three-tier system.
