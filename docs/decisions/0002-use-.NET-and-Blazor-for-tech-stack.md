# Use .NET and Blazor for tech stack

## Context and Problem Statement

The Advanced Media Library (AML) requires selection of a technology stack that supports development of a scalable library management system. The solution must work across multiple platforms including in-branch terminals, web browsers, and mobile devices, while enabling efficient development and maintenance.

We need to determine: Which technology stack will best support our requirements while utilizing existing team expertise?

## Decision Drivers

- Team's current technical expertise
- Cross-platform requirements (terminals, web, mobile)
- Need for unified business logic implementation
- Long-term maintenance and support considerations
- Performance for large-scale operations
- Integration with service-oriented architecture
- Development and deployment costs

## Considered Options

- .NET with Blazor for front-end
- Node.js with Express and Vue

## Decision Outcome

Selected ".NET with Blazor for front-end" based on existing C# expertise, cross-platform capabilities, and unified approach to business logic across platforms.

### Consequences

- Good, because team's C# experience enabled decent development with fewer defects
- Good, because shared code between backend/frontend improved maintainability
- Good, because Blazor's component model improved UI development
- Bad, because advanced .NET configuration requirements created initial hurdles

### Confirmation

Implementation began in Sprint 1. Initial configuration challenges were resolved by Sprint 2, resulting in a robust and functional system.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Node.js with Express and Vue

- Good, because JavaScript usage across stack simplifies technology requirements
- Good, because Vue provides lightweight frontend framework with moderate learning curve[2]
- Bad, because requires team training on JavaScript and Node.js ecosystem
- Bad, because less suitable for compute-intensive library operations
- Bad, because limited code sharing between backend and frontend compared to .NET

### .NET with Blazor

- Good, because enables C# usage for interactive web UIs, reducing JavaScript dependencies
- Good, because supports required cross-platform development
- Good, because integrates effectively with service-oriented architecture
- Bad, because may restrict access to some third-party library options
- Bad, because requires additional Blazor performance optimization in certain cases[2]

## More Information

The .NET and Blazor selection aligns with our service-oriented architecture, providing strong support for both building and consuming web services required by the library management system.
