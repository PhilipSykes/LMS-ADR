# Use .NET and Blazor for tech stack

## Context and Problem Statement

The Advanced Media Library (AML) requires a robust, scalable, and portable technology stack to build its comprehensive library management system. The system needs to support various access points, including in-branch terminals, web applications, and mobile devices. We need to choose a technology stack that allows for efficient development, maintainability, and portability across different platforms.

How can we select a technology stack that meets these requirements while leveraging our team's existing skills and ensuring long-term viability?

## Decision Drivers

- Team's existing experience and expertise
- Need for portability across different platforms (in-store terminals, web, mobile)
- Requirement for a unified approach to business logic implementation
- Long-term maintainability and support
- Performance requirements for handling large-scale operations
- Compatibility with Service-Oriented Architecture
- Cost-effectiveness in development and deployment

## Considered Options

- .NET with Blazor for front-end
- Node.js with Express and Vue

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: ".NET with Blazor for front-end", because it leverages our team's existing C# experience, provides excellent portability, and allows for a unified approach to business logic across all platforms.

### Consequences

- Good, because the team's familiarity with C# has lead to faster development and fewer errors.
- Good, because .NET has allowed for code sharing between backend and frontend, improving maintainability & development time.

### Confirmation

No current review performed of this ADR.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Node.js with Express and Vue

- Good, because it allows for JavaScript to be used on both frontend and backend, potentially simplifying the tech stack.
- Good, because Vue provides a lightweight and flexible frontend framework with a gentle learning curve.
- Bad, because some of our team would need to learn JavaScript and the Node.js ecosystem, leading to a steeper learning curve.
- Bad, because it might not be as suitable for computationally intensive tasks that could be required in some library management operations.
- Bad, because it doesn't allow for as much code sharing between backend and frontend as the .NET option.

### .NET with Blazor

- Good, because Blazor enables the development of interactive web UIs using C#, reducing the need for JavaScript expertise.
- Good, because .NET supports cross-platform development, aligning with our portability requirements.
- Good, because it integrates well with our chosen Service-Oriented Architecture.
- Bad, because it may limit our options for certain third-party libraries that are more common in other ecosystems.
- Bad, because it might require additional effort to optimize Blazor applications for performance in some scenarios.

## More Information

The decision to use .NET with Blazor aligns well with our previously chosen Service-Oriented Architecture. .NET provides robust support for building and consuming web services, which will be crucial in implementing our SOA design for the library management system.
